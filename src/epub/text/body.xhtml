<p class="par first">To open a poem with a few amatory lines, is a
literary tradition among Arab poets. But Abu’l-Ala, having had no
occasion to evince such tender emotions, whether real or merely
academic, succeeded, as in everything else he did, in deviating from
the trodden path. I find, however, in his minor Diwan, <i>Suct
uz-Zand</i><span class="corr" title="Source: ." id="xd21e2172">,</span>
a slight manifestation of his youthful ardor, of which this and the
succeeding quatrains, descriptive of the charms of Night, are fairly
representative.</p>

mythology, is said to have its roots in hell, and from which are fed
the dwellers of hell-fire. In one of the Chapters of the Koran, The
Saffat, I find this upon it: “And is that a pure bounty, or the
Zakkum tree? It is a tree which groweth in hell; its fruits are like
unto the heads of the devils, who eat from it, and from it fill their
stomachs.”</p>
<p class="par">Zakkum is also one of the bitter-fruited trees of
Arabia. And the people there speak of “a mouthful of
zakkum” when they want to describe an unhappy experience. It is
also the name of one of the plants of the desert, whose flower is like
the jasmine; and of one of the trees of Jericho, whose fruit is like
the date, but somewhat bitter.</p>

<p class="par">“The Luzumiyat” of Abu’l-Ala, as
rendered into English by Mr. Ameen Rihani, is more than a mere
translation—it is excellent poetry. Aside from its interest as a
literary curiosity, it possesses intrinsic value as literature of a
high quality. The historical matter contained in the preface of the
book, as well as the notes following the preface, will appeal to the
scholar who makes a study of the best expressions of Oriental
thought.—James B. Kenyon.</p>
<hr class="tb"/>
<p class="par"/>
<p class="par">The first English rendition of the Luzumiyat of
Abu’l-Ala, comes from Ameen Rihani, the author of the Book of
Khaled, who has selected the quatrains from three volumes of the works
of the Syrian poet. For those who cling to a childish haze concerning
Assyrians and Syrians, we would add that while the Assyrian comes down
like a wolf on the fold, the Syrian, at least this particular one, has
a tread like Omar Khayyam. Therein lies the chief interest of the
Luzumiyat, unfair as it may be, in view of the fact that
Abu’l-Ala died at about the time Omar was born. So marked and
far-reaching is the resemblance, that we might almost bring ourselves
to the belief that in Omar Khayyam was recreated the soul of
Abu’l-Ala, with subtle changes, notable among them the casting
off of the tenets of prohibition, and a substitution of fatalism for
stoicism.—The Sun (New York). <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#xd21e2567" id="xd21e2567" class="pginternal">107</a>]</span></p>

<p class="par">What Fitzgerald did for the Man of Neishapur in his
wonderful version of the Rubaiyat, Mr. Rihani has done, in scarcely
inferior measure, for his own remote ancestor Abu’l-Ala. Mr.
Rihani, who is a poet and essayist in English as well as in Arabic, has
made a permanent addition to Literature. The Luzumiyat can not be
displaced.—Michael Monahan.</p>

<p class="par">Mr. Rihani has rendered valuable service to Literature
in making the career of “The Lucretius of Islam,” as he
happily calls him, known to the general reader in the English-speaking
world.... The similarity of the Luzumiyat to Omar Khayyam under certain
aspects, should win for Rihani’s brilliant rendering a generous
measure of recognition. As it is, the rare merits of the book, the
critical power of the preface, the skill and sincere feeling exhibited
in the verse, and the wide knowledge of English Literature shown in the
notes, make it, to my mind, a little masterpiece.—Percy
White.</p>

<p class="par">The similarity in some parts of the Luzumiyat to Omar
Khayyam is striking. But Abu’l-Ala, to my mind, is a greater
poet, and he is at times so remarkably modern. I am glad to make his
acquaintance through your excellent translation.—R. B.
Cunninghame Graham. <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#xd21e2581" id="xd21e2581" class="pginternal">108</a>]</span></p>

<p class="par">There is a compelling power in his attack on hypocrisy
and quackery, in his recognition of the supremacy of reason and the
human soul. Those who still fondly turn to the “Rubaiyat”
for enjoyment will surely find stimulus, too, and pleasure in these
ruthless rhymes.—Asia.</p>
